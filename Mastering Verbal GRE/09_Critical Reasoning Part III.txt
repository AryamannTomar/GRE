8. Generations of European History students have been taught that a political assassination caused the First World War. Without some qualification, however, this teaching is bound to mislead since the war would not have happened without the treaties and alliances that were already in effect and the military force that was already amassed. These were the deeper causes of the war, whereas the assassination was a cause only in a trivial sense. It was like the individual spark that happens to ignite a conflagration that was, in the prevailing conditions, inevitable.
Which one of the following most accurately restates the main point of the passage?
    A. The assassination did not cause the war since the assassination was only the last in a chain of events leading up to the war, each of which had equal claim to being called its "cause."
    B. The war was destined to happen since the course of history up to that point could not have been altered.
    C. Though the statement that the assassination caused the war is true, the term "cause" more fundamentally applies to the conditions that made it possible for that event to start the war.
    D. If the assassination had occurred when it did but less military force had at that time been amassed, the war's outbreak might have been considerably delayed or the war might not have occurred at all.
    E. Although the conditions prevailing at the time the war started made the war inevitable, if the war had not been triggered by the assassination, it would not have taken the course with which students of history are familiar.

9. Editorialist: The positions advanced by radical environmentalists often contain hypotheses that are false and proposals that are economically unfeasible. But, there is a positive role to be played even by these extremists because the social and political inertia regarding environmental issues is so stubborn that even small areas of progress can be made only if the populace fears environmental disaster, however, untenable the reasons for those fears may be.
Which one of the following most accurately expresses the editorialist's main argument?
    A. The little progress that has been made in improving the environment is mainly due to the fear created by radical environmentalists.
    B. Radical environmentalists, by promoting their views, stimulate progress on environmental issues.
    C. Social and political inertia is most effectively overcome by an extremely fearful populace, regardless of whether its fears are well-founded.
    D. Radical environmentalists often put forth untenable positions in order to produce the fear that is required to bring about moderate reforms.
    E. Radical environmentalists advocate positions without regard for factual support or economic feasibility.

10. Law enforcement officials and other experts on crime cautioned that the latest report which shows that violent crime increased in the United States for the first time in four ycars, up 2.5 percent in 2005 from the ycar before, does not necessarily mean that crime would start to run rampant again. The increase in violent crime came after years of successful crime reduction efforts all over the country in the 1990's. According to experts, after the sharp decreases during the 1990's, the crime rate from 2000 to 2004 was almost constant. The seven good years of crime decline ended when the 1990's ended. Now the challenge isn't so much to make the crime rate go down more, because that's not necessarily realistic, but the challenge is to make sure that the small blip doesn't become a big one.
The author is arguing that:
    A. crimes rates will not decrease after a seven-year period, and hence, there is no point in trying to reduce crime.
    B. after a certain point, crime rate will not decrease, and efforts should be directed at not allowing it to rise again.
    C. the number of crimes committed remains constant after a certain period, and the challenge would be to not allow it to rise again.
    D. the crime rate might not fall below a certain level, and hence, the challenge would be to ensure that it does not rise above that level.
    E. as the crime rate becomes constant the methods to combat crime should be changed

11. Tonsillitis is a potentially life-threatening ailment and so, more often than not, patients with symptoms that strongly indicate tonsillitis have their tonsils removed. The appropriate surgery is low at risk but is performed needlessly in about 18 percent cases. A newly developed scan for tonsillitis is highly accurate, with just two misdiagnoses for every 98 correct ones. Clearly then, by using this test, doctors can by and large avoid unnecessary removals of the tonsils without, however, performing any fewer necessary ones than before, since _.
Which of the following most logically completes the passage?
    A. patients who are rightly diagnosed with this test as not having tonsillitis invariably have medical conditions that are much less serious than tonsillitis.
    B. the misdiagnoses produced by this test are always instances of attributing tonsillitis to someone who does not, in fact, have it.
    C. all of the patients who are diagnosed with this test have insurance. 
    D. every patient who is diagnosed with this test as having tonsillitis has more than one of the symptoms generally associated with tonsillitis. 
    E. doctors will now have more free time on their hands.

12. It is widely believed that by the age of 80, perception and memory are significantly reduced from the levels at which they function at the age of 30. However, a recent study showed no difference in the abilities of 80-year-olds and 30-year-olds to play a card game devised to test perception and memory. Therefore, the belief that perception and memory are significantly reduced by the age of 80 is false.
The reasoning above is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to consider the possibility that:
    A. the study's card game does not test cognitive abilities other than perception and memory. 
    B. card games are among the most difficult cognitive tasks one can attempt to perform. 
    C. perception and memory are interrelated in ways we are not currently aware of. 
    D. the belief that 80-year-olds' perception and memory are reduced, results from prejudice against senior citizens.
    E. playing the study's card game requires fairly low levels of perception and memory.

13. A study by economists has found that children of homeowners stay in school longer than children of renters. So buying as home instead of renting one is a way for parents to improve the likelihood of their offspring staying longer in school.
The above argument is flawed because it
    A. proceeds as though a condition that by itself is enough to guarantee a certain result must always be present for that result to be achieved
    B. gives reasons for the truth of its conclusion that presuppose the truth of that conclusion 
    C. assumes without proof that two phenomena that occur together share an underlying cause 
    D. concludes that one phenomenon is the cause of another when at most what has been established is an association between them
    E. fails to recognize that a tendency widely shared by a subgroup within a given population will not necessarily be widely shared by that population as a whole

14. "Government" does not exist as an independent entity defining policy. Instead there exists a group of democratically elected pragmatists sensitive to the electorate, who establish policies that will result in their own re-clection. Therefore, if public policy is hostile to, say, environmental concerns, it is not because of governmental perversity but because elected officials believe that _ Which of the following best completes the passage above?
    A. environmentalists would be extremely difficult to satisty with any policy, however environmentally sound.
    B. environmental concerns are being accomodated as far as public funds permit.
    C. the public is overly anxious about environmental deterioration.
    D. the majority of voters vote for certain politicians because of those politicians' idiosyncratic positions on policy issues.
    E. the majority of voters do not strongly wish for a different policy.

15. Business schools have compulsory "math remedial courses" before the beginning of the curriculum for students from non-mathematics academic backgrounds like literature, psychology and biology. Critics of these courses point to a recent study showing that during the course of the MBA program, despite completing the remedial courses, the performance of these students in areas that require a knowledge of mathematics is weaker than that of students from a mathematics background. They, thus, say that remedial courses for math should be done away with, as they serve no purpose.
Which of the following studies presents the strongest counter-argument to this?
    A. A study that shows that 80% of MBA students have mathematics backgrounds.
    B. A study that shows that after the remedial course the performance of students from non-mathematics academic backgrounds in math-based tests was significantly better than in similar tests before the course.
    C. A study, which shows that business school graduates do not need a significant mathematical aptitude in order to perform well in their professional lives.
    D. A study showing that an increasing number of students at business schools are spocializing in areas like operations and finance, which require a significant mathematical aptitude.
    E. A study, which shows that the performance of students in arcas like Human Resource Management that do not require a mathematical aptitude is not dependent on their academic background.
