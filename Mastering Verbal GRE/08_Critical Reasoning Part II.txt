WEAKEN THE CONCLUSION
1. According to a recent survey in Country X, men who carry their mobile phones in their trousers are more likely to suffer from sterility than those who carry it in their jacket pockets. Cell phone manufacturers should be directed to pay millions in damages for not informing the customers, through warning labels, about the potential hazards of cell phone usage.
Which of the following, if true, most weakens the argument?
    A. Cell phone manufacturers are known to divulge information only to the extent that it does not affect their revenues in any direct or indirect manner.
    B. Men who carry their mobiles phones in their jacket pockets use them much lesser than those who carry them in their trouser pockets.
    C. Men who carry their mobile phones in their trousers pockets are smokers who do so because they use their jacket pockets for their cigarettes, which are proven to cause sterility.
    D. There has been no previous evidence of mobile phones causing sterility.
    E. Some men who carry their mobile phones in their trouser pockets do not suffer from sterility.

2. Transporting oil by using trucks involves the unavoidable risk of oil leakage. The alternative is to build pipelines, which have an even greater risk of a leakage. Thus, to continue safely transporting oil without curtailing oil use, we must use only trucks.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
    A. Oil leakage due to trucks can be more expensive than the leakage from pipelines.
    B. Truck leakage damages the road surface while pipeline leaks only damage subterranean soil.
    C. Oil consumption has been rising rapidly in recent years.
    D. Pipeline construction would involve land acquisition from farmers.
    E. It is possible to construct pipelines from reinforced material, which makes the risk of leakage significantly lower than that when using trucks.

3. The earliest Sumerian metal weapons found in Baghdad, Iraq, are about 2,500 years old. A few days back, archcologists in Baghdad found pottery, which is nearly 3,500 years old. This pottery resembles Sumerian pottery of a much later period, also found in Baghdad. The pottery designs are also very different from designs of pottery of other civilizations, which are known to have inhabited the area in other eras. So, we can conclude that there were definitely Sumerian settlements in Baghdad 3,500 years ago.
Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
    A. Sumerians were not known to trade in pottery.
    B. Pottery is a mark of highly evolved civilizations and the Sumerian civilization would have been only 100 years old, 3,500 years ago.
    C. The evidence shows that the pottery found was used to store agricultural produce in houses.
    D. Cultures that follow are known to adopt pottery styles of older civilizations.
    E. The metal weapons show a high level of development showing evidence of being forged by people with several centuries of experience in the same.

4. Researchers, who tested running shoes at three price levels, ranging from $80 to $150, found that low and midcost shoes within the same brand cushioned runners' feet just as well as high-cost ones - sometimes even better. The perception that if you pay more, you will get better shoes is grossly misplaced.
Which of the following strengthens the claim made above?
    A. The proportion people injured due to running is the same across users of shoes at various pnice ranges.
    B. Shoe manufacturers keep adding improvements to shoes in the form of cushioning gel pods, microprocessors and so-called thrust enhancers to make runners safer.
    C. The effectiveness of running is dependent on technique rather than the type of shoes.
    D. People tend to be less cautious while using expensive shoes than when using lower priced shoes.
    E. People have used basic running shoes for ages without suffering any serious injunies.

5. The Mayor of New Hartfarmshire has blamed the new manufacturing plant set up in the county a few months ago for the sudden rise in the incidence of water-bore diseases in the country. The Mayor in his address to the people has said that the pollution, caused by the disposal of the industrial waste by the new manufacturing plant, of the river that runs through Hartfarmshire was the cause of the rise in water-borne diseases.
Which of the following most strengthens the Mayor's argument against the manufacturing plant?
    A. In a similar case filed in a neighboring county, the local court had ruled in favor of the local municipality.
    B. The people of New Hartfarmshire have been badly affected by water-borne diseases.
    C. The rise in the pollution of the river has been due to the breakdown of the municipality garbage processing plant.
    D. The manufacturing plant's sewage treatment process does not mect the latest safety standards released by the government a month ago.
    E. The manufacturing plant has refused access to the municipal authorities to do a survey of the plant.

6. The male sage grouse has air sacs that when not inflated lie hidden beneath the grouse's neck feathers. During its spring courtship ritual, the male sage grouse inflates these air sacs and displays them to the female sage grouse. Some scientists hypothesize that this courtship ritual serves as a means for female sage grouse to select healthy mates.
Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the scientists' hypothesis?
    A. Some female sage grouses mate with unhealthy male sage grouses.
    B. Diseased male sage grouses treated with antibiotics were not selected by female sage grouses during the courtship ritual.
    C. Some healthy male sage grouses do not inflate their air sacs as part of the courtship ritual.
    D. Male sage grouses are prone to parasitic infections that exhibit symptoms visible on the birds' air sacs.
    E. The sage grouse is commonly afflicted with a strain of malaria that tends to change as the organism that causes it undergoes mutation.

BOLDFACE QUESTIONS
 * Take the highlighted statement in relation to the paragraph not only the statement itself 
7. According to economists, social activists wrongly portray corporations as institutions that are driven solely by the motive of profit/revenue maximization. They contend that the activists' argument that <b>no corporation makes an investment from which it does not expect a return</b> is not always true since there have been many examples of corporations that have started not-for-profit trusts that run schools and other institutions that contribute to social welfare. The economists' argument against the activists is not convincing because <b>corporations advertize their welfare activities in order to generate goodwill that translates into increased revenues</b>.
The two boldfaced portions play which of the following roles in the economists' argument?
    A. The first supports the conclusion of the economists' argument; the second calls that into question.
    B. The first states the assertion that the economists' conclusion refutes; the second states the conclusion that refutes the economists' assertion.
    C. The first supports an assertion that the economists' refute; the second supports the argument that refutes the economists' argument the economists' argument.
    D. The first supports the contention that the economists refute; the second states the conclusion against the economists' assertion.
    E. The first supports the contention that the economists refute; the second states the conclusion against the economists'.

8. A large number of HBS students signed the "MBA Oath" at graduation in response to the dramatic business failures of the past year. <b>The HBS student who organized the effort, and the HBS faculty members who inspired him, deserve great kudos</b> for raising in a powerful, symbolic way critical issues for MBA students about building a foundation of integrity for business performance-student commitments that are echoed at other business schools and now resonate in major media take-outs. But oaths (and codes) are empty, even hypocritical rhetoric if they're not backed by anything else. <b>In this period when trust in capitalism and business decision-making has been severely eroded</b>, the question is whether the MBA oath will (along with many other developments) effect consequential change.
In the argument given, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
    A. The first presents a particular course of action that the second refutes.
    B. The first lauds a particular course of action that the second refutes.
    C. The first appreciates a particular course of action about whose effectiveness the second expresses doubts.
    D. The first lauds a particular course of action and the second provides the reason why it might not be effective.
    E. The first praises a particular course of action whose effectiveness is called into question by the second.

9. A recent study led by Janet Werker, a psychologist, suggests that <b>children who learn two languages at once may have increased cognitive abilities such as enhanced visual and auditory sensitivity</b>. The findings run counter to the theory that suggests bilingualism may actually lead to language confusion. Benjamin Lee Whorf, the American linguist, once said, "Language shapes the way we think, and determines what we think about." Whorf's linguistic studies led to the principles of the Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity - a belief that speakers of different languages learn, think, and act differently depending on the language they speak and write. From Whorf's findings, one may conclude that <b>a child who engages in code-switching - the use of two or more languages in everyday interactions - will develop language confusion</b>.
In the paragraph given above, the two portions in boldface play which of the following roles?
    A. The first is a claim made by an argument in support of bilingualism and the second
    presents the position in a modified form.
    B. The first states the findings about a developmental trait and the second is a random judgement invalidating the stance of the first.
    C. The first states the findings about a particular developmental trait and the second invalidates that claim by citing another conjecture.
    D. The first is a hypothesis about a particular developmental trait and the second provides grounds for that position.
    E. The first supports a recommendation by citing relevant examples and the second suggests an alternate course of action.

STENGTHEN THE CONCLUSION
10. Generations of European History students have been taught that a political assassination caused the First World War. Without some qualification, however, this teaching is bound to mislead since the war would not have happened without the treaties and alliances that were already in effect and the military force that was already amassed. These were the deeper causes of the war, whereas the assassination was a cause only in a trivial sense. It was like the individual spark that happens to ignite a conflagration that was, in the prevailing conditions, inevitable.
Which one of the following most accurately restates the main point of the passage?
    A. The assassination did not cause the war since the assassination was only the last in a chain of events leading up to the war, each of which had equal claim to being called its "cause." 
    B. The war was destined to happen since the course of history up to that point could not have been altered.
    C. Though the statement that the assassination caused the war is true, the term "cause" more fundamentally applies to the conditions that made it possible for that event to start the war.
    D. If the assassination had occurred when it did but less military force had at that time been amassed, the war's outbreak might have been considerably delayed or the war might not have occurred at all.
    E. Although the conditions prevailing at the time the war started made the war inevitable, if the war had not been triggered by the assassination, it would not have taken the course with which students of history are familiar.
