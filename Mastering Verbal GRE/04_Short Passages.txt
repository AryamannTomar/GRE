Passage 1
The humanities are less likely than other science streams to get their due for their achievements. Debatably, this is so because the theories and conceptual constructs of humanities are especially accessible: human intelligence apprehends truths about human affairs with particular facility. And the discoveries of the humanities, once isolated and labeled, are grifly absorbed into conventional wisdom, whercupon they lose their distinctiveness as scientific advances.
This disregard of the humanities compares oddly with what many see as their overutilization. Game theory is pressed into service in studies of shifting international alliances. Evaluation research is called upon to demonstrate successes or failures of social programs. Prototypes from economics and demography become the determining tools for examining the financial base of social security. Yet this rush into practical applications is itself quite understandable: public policy must continually be made, and decision makers rightly feel that even tentative findings and untested theories are better guides to passing resolutions than no findings and no theories at all.
