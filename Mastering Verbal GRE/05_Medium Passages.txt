'Medium Passages'

Passage 1
It is often postulated that the mechanization of work has a ground-breaking effect on the lives of the people who operate new technology and on the community into which sechnology has been introduced. For instance, it has been predicted that the recruitment of women in industries took them out of their homes,their traditional sphere, and essentially altered their place in the community. In the eighteenth century, when women began to enter factories, Denis Baupin, a political figure in France, warned that by doing so, women would forgo their femininity. Jean Monnet, however, reasoned that women would be emancipated from the social, legal, and economic subeedination of the family by technological advancements that facilitate the employment of "the whole female sex into public industry". Experts thus disagreed concerning the social desirability of mechanization's effects, but they agreed that it would  transforms women's lives.
Anthropologists, specifically those researching the status of women throughout history, now vehemently challenge this assumption of the transforming power. They contest that such dramatic technological innovations such as the spinning mule. the power loom, the typewiter, and the vacuum cleaner and their use have not translated into equally dramatic social changes in women's economic position or in the prevaling assessment of women's contributions to work. The employment of young women in textile mills during the Industrial Revoluton wes largely an extension of an older pattern of unemployment of young, single women as domestics. It was not the change in office technology, but rather the segregation of secretarial work, previously seen as an appresticeship for novice supervisors, from administrative work that in the 1890's created a new class of "dead-end" jobs, thenceforth considered "women's work." The rise in the numbers of married women working outside their homes in the nineteenth century had little to do with the mechanization of housework and an incrcase in leisure time for these women than it did with their own economic necessity and with high marriage rates that diminished the available pool of single women workers, previously, in many cases, the only women business owners would employ.
Women's work has changed considerably in the past two centuries, moving from the household to the office or the factory, and later becoming mostly white-collar instead of blue-collar work. Fundamentally however, the circumstances under which women work have transformed little since before the Industrial Revolution: the identification of occupations by gender, lesser pay for women staff, jobs that require relatively low levels of skill and afford women very little opportunity for promotions all persist, while
women's household labor remains obstinately demanding. Contemporary historical research has led to
a major revision of the notion that technology is always inherently revolutionary in its effects on the community. Mechanization may even have further slowed any change in the conventional position of women both in the labor market and in the home.

    C. Mechanization has caused the nature of women's work to change since the Industrial
    Revolution.
    D. The mechanization of work creates whole new classes of jobs that did not previously exist.
    E. The mechanization of women's work, while ground-breaking in its eflects, has not, on the whole, had the deleterious effects that some critics had feared.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

6. It can be inferred from the passage that the author most probably believes which of the following to be true concerning those anthropologists who study the history of women?
